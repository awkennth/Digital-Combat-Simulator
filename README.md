Digital-Combat-Simulator
========================
The Digital Combat Simulator(ospDCS) is a piece of software similar to the Combat
Simulator utilized on the Spike Tv Show Deadliest warrior.  The Initial Goal would
be to create a Python Powered Application that allows users to input a set of statistics
for a human warrior, and his armor and weapons.  And the Engine will be able to run simulations
to determine which of the warriors will be victorious in a death match.

Planned Features:
Human Characteristics class -> An Object that contains all the Statistics for an human warrior
Equipment Class -> an Object that contains all the statistics for a piece of weaponry or armour
Combat Engine -> Engine Responsible for receiving JSON or Object representation of a warrior and
his equipment and accurately predict battle outcome

Future Features:
